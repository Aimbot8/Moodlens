# Moodlens

The objective of this is to propose an
approach real-time facial sentiment analysis framework
called MoodLens, classifying emotions into seven
categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and
surprise. By using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
for automated feature extraction, the whole process can be
done without any human input. This also solves the
accuracy, scalability, and adaptability issues that traditional
machine learning models have. Sculpted for application in
the real world, MoodLens incorporates real-time streaming
techniques, taking human-computer interaction to the next
level in healthcare, entertainment, security, education, and
beyond.The framework is a strong and effective way to do
sentiment analysis. It uses advanced preprocessing
techniques, dropout layers to prevent overfitting, and a
scalability design to classify things accurately in changing
environments
